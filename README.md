It seems that the active file readme.md is currently empty, as there is no code or content in the file. Markdown files like readme.md are typically used to provide documentation or instructions about a project. For example, they might include an introduction to the project, setup instructions, usage examples, or other relevant details.

What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources (like servers, databases, and networking components) using a declarative configuration language. Terraform is widely used for automating cloud infrastructure on platforms like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and others.

Key Features of Terraform:
Declarative Language: You describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform figures out how to achieve it.
Provider Support: Terraform supports many providers (e.g., AWS, Azure, Kubernetes) to manage resources across different platforms.
State Management: Terraform maintains a state file to track the current state of your infrastructure, enabling it to determine changes needed to reach the desired state.
Plan and Apply: Terraform provides a plan command to preview changes before applying them, ensuring safe updates.
Modular Design: You can create reusable modules to organize and share infrastructure configurations.
If you'd like, I can help you write a basic Terraform example or add content to your readme.md file to describe Terraform or your project. Let me know!


Hereâ€™s a sample code snippet to expand the resources in your Terraform files. I'll add examples for creating an Azure Storage Account and a Virtual Network, which can complement your existing resourcegroup.tf and providers.tf files.

Updated resourcegroup.tf with Additional Resources
Explanation of the Added Resources
Storage Account:

The azurerm_storage_account resource creates a storage account in the specified resource group.
It uses Standard tier and LRS (Locally Redundant Storage) replication.
Virtual Network:

The azurerm_virtual_network resource creates a virtual network with an address space of 10.0.0.0/16.
It is associated with the same resource group and location as the resource group.
Let me know if you'd like to add more resources or customize these further!

Note : Storage Account and Virtual Network we will see in upcoming sesisons.
